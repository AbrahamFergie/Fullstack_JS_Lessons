  <h1>How do you solve a problem?</h1>
  <p>Use the debugger!</p>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open this file in Chrome</li>
    <li>Open developer tools</li>
    <li>In the JavaScript console, inspect some_object by typing the variable name in the console.</li>
    <li>You can run any JavaScript you like in the console as if you were at that line of code in the execution of your program.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can access properties on an object just like you would in your JS code!</p>
  <ul>
      <li>some_object.name</li>
      <li>some_object.age</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Notice how much time this can save you to diagnose issues. If a function is broken, put a debugger where you think the issue is and JavaScript will enter the console from that spot.</p>

  <script>
    var some_object = {name: 'John Doe', age: 25};
    debugger;
    console.log("Now the rest of your code runs once you leave the debugger.");
