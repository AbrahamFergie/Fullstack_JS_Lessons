# Instructor / TA Checklist

Ahoy! Here are some general tips and reminders for what to have done at each point of the week. 

If you have any outstanding questions, check with your SSM or review your [Training GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/the-coding-bootcamp/instructor-onboarding?key=TeachThatCode) which has all sorts of helpful information in it.

## Beginning of the Week

* Prepare!

* Review the next homework assignment.

## Before Class Starts

* Do a `git pull` of the [FullStack-Lesson-Plans](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans) repo.

* Push any `Unsolved` activities and slideshow to the class repo for today's lesson.

## Beginning of Class

## During Class

* **All** instructional team members should be circulating the room and helping out during activities!

* **TAs**

  * Monitor the `TimeTracker.xlsx` file and collaborate with the Instructor to make adjustments to the class schedule if needed.   
    
  * Slack out activity instructions contained in each activity's `README.md` file.
