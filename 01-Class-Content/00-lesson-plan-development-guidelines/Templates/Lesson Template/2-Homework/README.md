# Homework instructions

## Overview

The **Overview** section should include a thorough description of the week's homework assignment. The description should be a sufficiently complete that a top student would be able to complete the assignment to specification without having to refer to the instructions.

## Instructions

The **Instructions** section should include a series of high-level notes as to how to approach the project, and should be written as bullet points.

* A Well-written instruction consists of one or two sentences.

* Instructions should be specific enough to recall a specific learning objective, but not so specific as to guide students directly to the answer.

  * **Do** write: "Implement a middleware function that only forwards secure requests. Refer to the Express documentation if necessary."

  * **Do not** write: "Implement a middleware that calls `next` if its `req` object's `secured` property evaluates to true."

* Aim to provide instructions corresponding to each requirement in the grading rubric.

## Minimum Requirements

*Note: Should be present in each non-project homework description.*

Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions. If unable to pseudocode or complete parts of the assignment, leave comments in the code to describe what remains to be completed, what issues you ran into, and how you would approach it given more time.
