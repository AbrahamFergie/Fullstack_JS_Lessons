# Unit Objectives

The **Unit Objectives** document sets forth the formal learning objectives required for students to complete the week's homework assignment. Learning Objectives should guide the development of lesson plan activities. Ideally, students who accomplish the complete set of learning objectives defined in this document should be able to complete the week's homework assignment with minimal difficulty.

Each lesson plan in the unit will address a subset of the objectives in this document. Taken together, all three of a unit's lesson plans will cover all of the objectives in this document.

### Django learning Objectives

Learning objectives should be defined in terms of **conditions**; **criteria**; and **skills**. Each of these qualities is defined below.

* Components of Learning Objectives

  * **Conditions** specify what starting conditions in which students will be instructed and/or will be expected to learn. This includes technologies students are provided with; the details of their development environments; the condition of an inherited codebase they are to work with; etc.

    * **Example**: _Given_ a virtual environment running Python 3.4.x and a global installation of the Pip package manager...

  * **Skills** are the specific skills we aim to instruct.

    * **Example**: A student will be able to _write a view that processes both GET and POST requests in Django_.

  * **Criteria** are metrics defining the degree to which a student must be able to perform the objective in order for their acquisition to be deemed adequate. Criteria are often implied by the skills and conditions statements.

    * **Example**: The view students write to process GET and POST requests does not throw errors, and handles GET and POSTS requests appropriately (implied criterion).

Generally, the entire set of a unit's objectives can be expressed in relation to the same condition statement. In such cases, structure objectives as follows:

* Given _condition_, students should be able to...

  * Use X to:

    * Perform _skill_ to _criterion_ degree of satisfaction.

Finally, it is worthwhile to annotate objectives with a **degree**, rated from 1 to 3, where 1 indicates an objective students must meet for basic competency in the unit's technology; 2 indicates an important but pedagogically non-essential best practice; and 3 indicates a "stretch" objective, whose acquisition is optimal but irrelevant to either the homework assignment. Such degree labels help prioritize time allotments in lesson plans.
