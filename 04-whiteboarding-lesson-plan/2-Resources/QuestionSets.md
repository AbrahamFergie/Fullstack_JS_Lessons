# Question Sets

Feel empowered to construct your own run-of-show for whiteboarding workshops, by either selecting problems from the [Interview Questions](../../03-interview-qs) directory or creating your own.

Should you not have the time to make your own selections or create your own problems, we recommend the following sets of questions.

### Whiteboarding Workshop 1

The following serve as "warm-up" problems for the first interview round.

* [FizzBuzz](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/fizz_buzz)

* [Global `var`](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/global_var)

The following serve as achievable, but challenging, implementation problems.

* [Scope & Closure](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/scope_and_closure)

* [Pig-Latinize](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/pig_latinize)

* [Array Deep Equals](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/array_deep_equals)

* [isInteger](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/is_integer)

The following are intended to provide students with experience thinking and talking through problems they are likely unable to solve, both to familiarize them with the discomfort of tackling intractable problems and to introduce them to concepts that are otherwise difficult to contextualize.

* [Buy Low, Sell High](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/buy_low_sell_high)

* [Highest Product of Two](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/highest_product_of_two)

* [Global `var`, Pt. II](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/global_var_in_button_click)

The following serve as achievable, but challenging, implementation problems.

The following are intended to provide students with experience thinking and talking through problems they are likely unable to solve, both to familiarize them with the discomfort of tackling untractable problems and to introduce them to concepts that are otherwise difficult to contextualize.

* [Curried Sum](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/curried_sum)

* [Recursion, Pt. I: Maximum Element in a List](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions/recursive_max_element)
