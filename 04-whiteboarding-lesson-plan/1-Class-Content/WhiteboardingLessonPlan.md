## Whiteboarding Lesson Plan

### Overview

Today's workshop is an opportunity for students to review and practice technical interview guidelines in a peer-review setting.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should systematically apply the problem solving guidelines with each problem.

  * They can deviate once they've internalized the format, but _not_ before.

* Students should honestly evaluate their partners' performance on the grading rubric.

  * Students may wish to self-evaluate, as well.

##### Instructor Notes

* Emphasize that the purpose of these workshops is not primarily to find the correct answer to these questions.

  * Rather, it is to train students to take the right _approach_ to problem solving.

  * Emphasize that, at this stage, following the guidelines matters more than finding the correct solution.

    * Explain that this is because excellent communication is one of the most sought-after traits interviewers screen for.

* Choose a collection of interview questions for the workshop ahead of time. These are available in the [Interview Questions](../../03-interview-qs/1-Interview-Questions) repository.

  * You will need one question for each 30 minute interview—partners will _not_ work on the same interview problems successively.

  * This entails roughly 6 - 10 interview questions per workshop.

  * Suggested "sets" of interview questions are available in the [Question Sets document](../2-Resources/QuestionSets.md).

* Have your TAs reference the `Workshop Time Tracker` to help keep track of time.

  * More important than the Time Tracker is that students have adequate time to work through interview problems.

  * Each student has 25 minutes to work through a problem. Once the 25 minutes is up, students switch. They have 5 minutes to review feedback with one another before rotating pairs or interview questions.

### Class Objectives

After class, students should be able to:

* Verbalize programming problems before they solve them;

* Explain their approach to solving problems;

* Identify and articulate assumptions they make about problems they work on; and

* Discuss shortcomings and improvements they might make to solutions they develop.

### 1. Instructor Do: Introduce and Review Problem Solving Guidelines (0:15)

* Slack out the [Peer Interview Grading Rubric](../2-Resources/PeerTechnicalInterviewRubric.xlsx)

* Slack out the `NotesToTheInterviewer`

* Slack out the [Problem Solving Guidelines](../2-Resources/TechnicalInterviewGuidelines.pdf), and open them yourself.

* Explain the importance of communication in the technical interview process.

  * Obviously, optimal solutions are of crucial importance, but excellently communicating a suboptimal but correct solution is the priority for this set of workshops.

* Explain the major steps of the communication process. Namely:

  * Restating/explaining the problem with a **concrete example**;

  * Explaining a solution approach at a high level;

  * Discussing assumptions, shortcomings, and other properties of the proposed solution;

  * Discussing alternative solutions;

  * Talking the interviewer through your translation of the solution sketch into real code;

  * Discussing the solution after implementation, including potential improvements; and

* Remember to emphasize the importance of interacting with the interviewer.

* If you've covered this material in a previous interview workshop, feel free to skim or skip this section, so long as students have the guidelines and grading rubrics.

  * In other words, feel free to abbreviate your verbal review, but _always_ slack out the resources—even if you have slacked them out before.

### 2. Partners Do: First Partner Interviews (0:30)

* Break students into pairs. They can work with seatmates to start, as they'll rotate throughout class.

  * Instruct groups to decide amongst themselves who will play the role of interviewer, and who the role of interviewee.

* Instruct the interviewer to fill out the **Interviewer** and **Interviewee** fields in their rubrics.

* Slack out an interview question for students to work on, and start a timer for 5 - 7 minutes.

  * This 5 minute allowance is for the **Interviewer** to review the interview question README and solution.

  * The **Interviewee** can spend this time reviewing JavaScript, or simply waiting for the interview to start.

* When time is up, tell students to start interviews, and set a timer for 25 minutes.

  * Remind students to **systematically implement the problem solving guidelines**.

    * It's okay if they have to refer to them.

    * Explain that they will be free to work in a more "freeform" manner when they've internalized this basic approach.

### 3. Partners Do: Second Partner Interviews (0:30)

* After 25 minutes, instruct partners to swap roles, such that the interviewee now plays the role of interviewer, and vice versa.

* Slack out a new question for the interviewee to work on.

  * Set a timer for 5 minutes, such the interviewer can review the new question.

  * When the five minutes are up, set a timer for 25 minutes, so that students can interview.

* Again, emphasize the importance of implementing the problem solving guidelines to a tee.

### 4. Partners Do: Trade Feedback (0:05)

* After 20 minutes, have students trade rubrics and discuss each others' performance.

* This should be mostly positive in tone—have students identify:

  * What their partners did best; and

  * What they should focus on improving during their next interview.

* Encourage students to avoid discussing the solutions at this stage; the important piece is not the answers, but how well students communicated their thought processes.

### 5. Partners Do: Repeat (Remainder)

* Allow 2 minutes for groups to switch partners, so that each individual works with a new classmate.

  * This can be as simple as one partner shifting seats to the left, and one shifting seats to the right.

* Repeat the procedure outlined in sections **2** through **4** for the remainder of class.

* If the final interview round would run over the end of class, you have two choices:

  * Adjust the time allotments for the final round of interviews to fit class necessary—two 15 minute sessions is acceptable, for instance.

  * Swap roles. Have students choose a question for you to work on, and verbalize your problem solving strategy for them.

    * Alternatively, work through a problem with the class as a whole.

### 6. Conclusion (0:00)

* Slack out the solutions for each interview question students worked on today for later review.

  * Emphasize that the solutions are of secondary importance to adequate communication.
