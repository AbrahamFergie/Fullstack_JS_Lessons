## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant (code of conduct)
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to <mailto:curriculum@trilogyed.com>.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

* **Detailed Location** of the issue. Please include a markdown link to where the problem is. State where the issue is. E.G - Lesson, Activity, Homework, timetracker, or slideshow.

* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Be sure to list steps you took to encounter the problem if applicable.

* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

* **Include screen-shots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

If relevant (e.g. when setting up software, or having inconsistencies across different setups) include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**

e.g.

```
#### There is a typo in Lesson Plan 2.1, section 5

* Title - Typo in Lesson Plan 2.1

* Body - `[Lesson Plan 2.1](www.somewhere.com)` I was in the Lesson Plan 2.1 and in section 5. It says `I am dancing on wolves`. It should be `I am dancing with wolves`.
```

* Keep in mind that GitHub allows users to drop images into the comment box

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the curriculum, including completely new features, lesson plans, and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestions is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.

* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to students, instructors, etc. - whoever the enhancement is for.

Also, if relevant:

* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/paste-able snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

* **List some other resources, curriculum, and/or programs supporting the enhancement's relevancy.**

* **Include screen-shots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the curriculum the suggestion is related to.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

* Issues with the `beginner` tag - these should only require a few lines of code and are good targets if you're just starting contributing. E.g. [FullStack `beginner` issues](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22beginner%22))

* Issues with the `help-wanted` tag - these range from simple to more complex, but are generally things we want but can't get to in a short time frame. E.g. [FullStack `help-wanted` issues](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22help+wanted%22)

#### How to contribute

To contribute to the repo, you'll use the Fork and Pull model common in many open source repositories:

1. [Fork the repo on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

2. Clone your fork.

3. Make and commit the changes locally.

4. Run tests to ensure everything is working. Make necessary changes to ensure tests are passing.

5. Push the changes to your fork.

6. Make a pull request to the main repository.

There are a number of guides on how to do this online if you run into any problems.

* [GitHub Forking Repos](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

* [GitHub Branching](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
