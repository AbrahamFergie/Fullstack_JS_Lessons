Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It’s hard for us to know what these areas are unless we’re asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans
we would appreciate your feedback at the following link if you have not already taken the end-of-course survey:

### Overview

In this class, students who have opted-in to career services will work on their portfolios and any unfinished career homework assignments.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students are supported in creation of their portfolios like any other HW assignment or project.

* Students opted out of Career Services are encouraged to participate - it's the developer's resume! However, they are welcome to work on final projects.

##### Instructor Notes

* Students' portfolio assignment in bootcampspot will contain requirements & guidance to get students started.

* Defer to CDs when it comes to advice on items like Resumes or Linkedin presence. We want to ensure that we are presenting students with a consistent message.

* As Instructors / TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students post-bootcamp is largely dictated by the quality of their final projects and portfolios. Encourage and help steer them in every way you can towards high-quality production!
