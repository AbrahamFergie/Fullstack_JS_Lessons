## Day 2 - Group Projects <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../01-Day/01-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

In this class, students will finish their projects and make their presentations.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects & presentations.

* Make sure your students have made a presentation and practiced once by the end of class.

##### Instructor Notes

* Once again, your students' success post-bootcamp depends on the quality of their projects. Their presentations compose much of this quality—students need to think about how to communicate the development process of their apps if they hope to impress interviewers with their experience.
