## Projects & Intro to Computer Science

### Overview

The first part of this week is the regionalized content unitâ€”different universities will teach different tech depending on local market demand. Please check your syllabus to see which content applies to your class.

After priming students to start conceptualizing their final projects, we will also introduce them to the fundamental concepts and terminology of computer science. The intent is to provide them with just enough to contextualize technical interview questions and enable further study. We intentionally omit rigorous exercises to allow students to focus on projects.
