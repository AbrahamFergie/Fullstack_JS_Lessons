## 20.3 Lesson Plan - Review, Homework, Final Projects <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../04-Day/04-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; 

### Overview

After doing a review of Databases and React and giving some help and time for students to work on their homework, you'll prime your students to conceptualize their final projects. You'll run down the list of expectations and requirements for each of their weekly deliverables. Aside from that, you and the TAs will stick around to make sure each team has a solid idea for their project--they should have one by the end of the class.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should get time to ask questions and get help reviewing Databases and React content in preparation for their final project.

* Students should get time to work on homework and receive help with any questions they may have.

* Students should know all of their responsibilities for the final project.

* Students should come out of class with a high-level grasp of how their app will function--what does it do and what problem does it solve?

### Class Objectives

* To lead a review time with your students for any questions they may still have about prior material since their second project. Primarily Databasing and React content.

* To help students with their current homework assignment as it is a hard one!

* To spur students to flesh out some finial project ideas, recruit team members, and figure out what their apps will do.

### 1. Instructor Do: Lead a review on Databases and React (45 mins)

* We are going to open today's class with a review on some content we have covered since the conclusion of Project 2. Primarily we will be reviewing Databases and React in preparation for your final projects.

* Open the floor to students with specific questions about anything they may not be clear on, including any databasing material or React questions.

* After students have had time to ask specific questions, go into a basic review of Database material.

* After completing your review of Databases, begin a review of the React content that has been covered over the past few classes to make sure students have a solid grasp of the fundamentals for their final project.

### 2. Everyone Do: Work on homework! (30 mins)

* Now its time for students to do some work on their Homework and get help with whatever they may be stuck on!

their app idea, now is the time.
