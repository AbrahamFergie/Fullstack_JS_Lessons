## 24.1 Lesson Plan - Project Work (6:30 PM) <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../../23-Week/03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

During this lecture, most of class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check up on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward presentations. 

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their projects.

##### Instructor Notes

* Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps soon so they have optimal time to practice their presentations.

* It's **crucial** that you steer any off-course projects back on track.

  * To that end, you should remind students that they can reach out to you and the TAs for support outside of class.

### 0. Welcome Class (0 mins)

* Say your hellos and check if students have any questions about past concepts.

### 1. Instructor Do: Ask About Projects (5 mins)

* Tell your students how you're excited to see the projects they'll present. You should talk about how you're impressed with the concepts they've come up with, that they should feel proud about working toward the goals they devised.

  * Assure them that they've come a long way over the length of this course.
  
  * Answer these reassuringly—if you ever had similar doubts, chime in with your experiences on overcoming them.  
  
  * If no one says anything, they're likely apprehensive about admitting fears to their classmates. Assure them that if they're anxious about their project work, then no doubt other students feel the same way. Encourage them to share these thoughts—talking about them is an essential step to overcoming them.

### 2. Everyone Do: Project Work (85 mins)

* Add in that they should come into the next class expecting to devote at least 30 minutes to outlining their presentations.

* TAs and Instructors: For the next 90 minutes, you're Senior Developers! Bounce around breakout rooms as mentors for each group's team. Ask them about their progress so far; offer them advice on how they can finish their work in time.

* Maybe a member of the team finished all the work their role entailed. Perhaps they're waiting for other people to complete a certain task before they can continue. Make sure any students in these situations ask their teammates how else they can help.
 
* Some students might be stumped by technology that they hadn't gone over in class but are trying to use in their project. See if you can help out. If you're not familiar with the tech, direct the encumbered student to someone on the Boot Camp team who is.
 
* In any case, just make sure all teams seem prepared to complete their projects by the final day.
